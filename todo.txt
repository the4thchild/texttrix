This file is no longer used for tracking releases, but rather for recording immediate ToDo's.
See http://texttrix.wiki.sourceforge.net/ToDo for the latest release and pre-release updates.

----Immediate Tasks----

-check selection alignment when switching to HTML view
-check syntax highlight re-formatting after undo
-check on Ostermiller no-such-element exceptions
-check on occasional tab memory and reopening loss or additions
-check on RepaintManager exceptions during various copy/paste/undo combinations (seen on Fedora 9 java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-0.13.b09.fc9.i386)
-launch via Java Web Start; INPROGRESS: workaround to launch file (now including the toolbar) successfully, but still need to identify plugin folder
-option to turn on/off syntax highlighting in prefs panel; DONE
-fix contextual scrolling when less than one screen of text; FIXED
-tool tip for import/export preferences; DONE

----Ideas----

-check on lost I-bar after switching to HTML view
-MacOS X compatibility
	-check on lack of shortcuts in MacOS X
	-about dialog box
-feature to insert hard returns after a given number of characters or for given visible space
-elim multiple spaces via Extra Returns Remover
-check on shortcuts in HTML/RTF views
-plug-ins: listener types create listeners that TextTrix attaches to given TextPad
-"Letter Pulse" plug-in
	-check on auto-indent adjustments after switching tabs in the middle of a pulse session
	-make HTML-view pulsing possible
-use java.util.ResourceBundle for internationalization and further keybinding customization
-auto-indent: adjust when single word spans multiple lines, including when hit enter in the middle
-automatically auto-indent lists: documentListener waits for single hard returns, which flags to check if the head of a continuous sequence of adjacent, preceding, text-containing lines starts at the beginning of the line while the lines in the rest of the sequence each begins with list delimiters; if next typed charcter is a list-delimiter, turns on auto-indent for the given region; similar algorithm when loading files
-when saving an already existing file, match the file filter with the file's extension
-Plug-ins
	-plug-ins' pref list fields sizes
	-plug-in: spell checker
	-plug-in: spell-check any given text in system clipborad, displaying corrected text in Text Trix pad

	-Search plug-in
		-option to search backward
-preferences panel to choose default paths and file type filters
-Java Web Start compatibility
-option to remember which specific files used auto-indent
-Tabbed pane updates
	-when have multiple files with same filename, add more of path to tab titles
	-truncate filenames on tabs
-print images and multi-formatted text
-rename files in place
-TablePad for spreadsheets, including tXtFL player-creation plug-in
-Wrap-indent
	-update indents when paste over selected area
-command-line arg not to reopen files or for quiet operation
-check on completeness of $(TARGET_FILES) in cleans
-pref for hanging indent size
-launch remotely, w/o installation: bundle entire application, including plugins, within single jar; mechanism to add plugins directly into the jar
-Search plugin looks through multiple files
-file management:
	-working copy mode: allows user to work on a copy of the file rather than the file itself, then see and apply changes as desired
	-file locking
	-read-only mode
-integrate with Jar Ajar plug-in installation mode
