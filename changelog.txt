----v.0.3 Series: FEATure Series (FEATS)----
--------------------------------------

----v.0.3.2 (3/15/03)------

Text Trix, the text tinkering tool, now has a plugin architecture to easily add new tools or trix.  Not everyone wants the same text manipulators; now each person can pick and choose.  What's left is to build a repertoire of plugins.

The main impediment to recent Text Trix development had been getting over the plugin hump.  The idea of adding tiny, self-sufficient packages for each new tinkerer proved attractive, but methods to load and use them proved quite the opposite.  Also, with the major football season rolling around, work on another text project (tXtFL (http://textflex.com/txtfl) became increasingly enticing.

But the football season is over for now; it's time for school and work again, where text tools would likely have more practical use than text football would.  Extra motivation to get going with the plugins came from an unexpected source: bugs that stopped the tinkerers from working on one popular operating system.  With the new archicture and bug fixes emerges the new version, Text Trix v.0.3.2.  Its plugin architecture awaits contibutions for new tools and trix!

New features include:
-Plugin architecture to allow users to selet the particular tools and trix they want
-Open multiple files at once
-Open files from the command-line at startup; try using Text Trix as the default program to open files
-Carets now return approximately to their original location after using text tools or trix
-Dialog windows provide alternative options when opening or saving to unpermitted locations

Bug fixes include:
-Text tools now work consistently and in all tested platforms (691520)
-The function to find whole words now finds them (699860)
-Popup menus work also consistently across tested platforms (696328)
-Tabbed pane tool tips update to show the new file name after saving a file for the first time (699865)

----v.0.3.1 (8/26/02)----

One might miss out on many trix if Text Trix lacked support for 
colored text, different fonts, and images.  Let the situation remain 
hypothetical, for Text Trix now offers HTML and RTF formatted 
text viewing.  Now the editor just needs some trix.  As for tools, 
Text Trix can tinker with the whole text or only selected text now, 
and the auto-indent feature makes coding in Text Trix--such as 
programming trix, for example?--more feasible.

-HTML and RTF viewing, including conversion of plain text to 
HTML-tagged text
-Auto-indent, selectable for each text pad
-Open/save as dialogs return to the current tab's working directory 
or the last opened/saved as directory
-Tab-cycling shortcut keys that work within text pads
-HTML replacer additions: removes extraneous spaces and 
replaces some common character entities, such as "&nbsp;"
-Text pad popup menu, including copy/paste menu items
-Various bug fixes

----v.0.3.0 (7/23/02)----

The feature craze has begun!  With the beginnings of an HTML tag 
replacer, a non-printing-character display, and a fully featured 
find/replace tool, the "Trix" in Text Trix is bearing fruit.  A few 
interface improvements round out the Basic User Graphics Series 
(BUGS) and make way for the Feature Future of futuristic features.

-rudimentary HTML tag replacer, removing all HTML-style tags 
and replacing them with text representations where appropriate
-find/replace function, including options to search for expressions 
as separate words, ignore case, replace first/all, selection search, 
and wrapped search
-non-printing-character display, adding the displays into the text 
explicitly
-focuses on Text Pad immediately after start-up
-cancelled save during window frame closure and in exiting save 
dialogs prevent the exit
-open/save boxes now attached to main Text Trix window
-equivalency string tables in preparation for preferences feature

----------------------------------------------

----v.0.1.5 (6/26/02)----

The basic user interface portion of Text Trix is nearing completion.
This release focuses on large structural changes and text 
tools.  Structural work prepares for the Txtrx command-
line version of Text Trix and makes the code more extensible.  
Features work centers on making the Extra Hard Return 
Remover more efficient and less buggy while conferring the
ability to remove " > "'s common in email replies.  Additionally, 
word deletion is in place.

-Extra Hard Return Remover additions and updates, including 
inline message reply sign (eg " > ") and "<pre>" tag removal, 
as well as more efficient processing
-tool bar, icons, and extra menus, including their shortcuts
-word delete, including Emacs keybindings for it and word
movement
-file-changed indicator update: no delay

----v.0.1.4 (4/27/01)----

-caret moves to beginning of document after opening it
-bug fix: syncs tab index with arraylist index
-added About and License menu items
-switched file input to getResourceAsStream for possible
applet use in future

----v.0.1.3 (3/24/02)----

-file open and save as options

-enhanced superfluous hard return checK: now ignores spaces
before dashes or asterisks when checking to allow listed
