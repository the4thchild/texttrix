----v.0.9.3 (2010-01-??)----

Text Trix now sports a spell-checker to sit alongside the recently introduced 
syntax highlighter for stronger visualization of text.  Adapted from the jOrtho 
open-source library, this spell-checker comes complete with inline highlighting 
and spelling suggestions.  Improvement have also been made to tab memory, 
including the "--cleartabs" option to start completely afresh.  While the last 
release allowed for side-by-side file viewing through multiple windows, this 
release remembers tabs opened across windows and restores them on next 
launch.  File modification detection ensures that if an opened file has been 
modified elsewhere (e.g. via Subversion), the editor will flag the update and 
prompt for a file refresh.

New features/bug fixes:
-Integrated spell-checker (via jOrtho open-source library)
-Tab memory and restoration across multiple windows
-"--cleartabs" option to completely clear tab memory upon launch
-File modification polling and notification when open files are updated elsewhere

----v.0.9.2 (2009-02-25)----

This bug fix release of the Text Trix editor features improved user 
experience on Mac systems and a performance lift on all systems.  Apple 
"Command" options have been implemented for Mac shortcuts, and scrolling 
has been fixed as well.  Syntax highlighter performance has improved 
dramatically for slower systems.  Word Find has been fixed to start searching 
from the current position and to respond to more familiar shortcuts on both 
the Mac and PC.  Backward compatibility support for Java 1.4 has been added 
for AIX and OS/2 systems.

New features/bug fixes:
-Mac shortcuts added and scrolling bug fixed
-Performance improvements while syntax highlighting
-Word Find starts searching from current position
-Backward compatibility with Java 1.4+

----v.0.9.1 (2008-07-25)----

The editor now offers formatted text options, including an automatic view 
switcher for html viewing and saving.  Font style, size, color, and alignment 
can be changed through a new format menu.  Files can also be viewed 
side-by-side through multiple instances of the Text Trix main window.  
Other changes include a syntax highlighter preference option and fixes for 
contextual scrolling and remembering auto-indent file extensions.

New features:
-Text formatting, including font style, size, color, and alignment (by John 
Kozalan)
-Automatic HTML view switcher for formatted text
-Syntax highlighting preference option
-Multiple instances for viewing files side-by-side (note that only tabs in the
exiting window will be remembered for reopening)

Bugs fixed:
-Contextual scrolling with less than one screen of text
-Remembering auto-indent file extensions

----v.0.9.0 (2008-06-18)----

The Text Trix editor now features syntax highlighting, search navigation 
improvements, and many fixes for building and startup.  The GPL-licensed 
Ostermiller syntax highlighter has been incorporated to automatically color 
and format text according to the given file type.  Search improvements 
include the ability to search backward in Word Find (Shift+F3), as well as 
contextual scrolling for viewing found text in its context.

Line Dance also includes several fixes and now automatically names lines 
based on selected text.  Text is more mobile through drag-n-drop.  
Build improvements include updated editor and plugin build scripts as 
simpler compilation mechanisms than the configure/Makefile combination, 
and startup errors on Vista platforms have been fixed.  Several new 
command-line options have been added, including Fresh mode (to 
temporarily launch without reopening tabs) and no highlighting (for slower
systems).

This release has been tested on Java 5 and 6 (including 6u10-b24 and 
OpenJDK) and on Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms.

Enhancements:
-Syntax highlighting, using the Ostermiller Syntax Highlighter package
-Reverse Word Find (Shift+F3), the counterpart to Find Next (F3)
-Contextual Scrolling during searches
-Line Dance automatically names line if text is highlighted
-Automatically highlights Word Find and Line Find boxes for quicker searching

----v.0.7.0 (2007-01-01)----

Text Trix is general purpose editor that makes coding easier and more precise.  
Navigational tools help make large files easier to read and organize.  Special 
plugins manipulate text according to user-defined settings.

v.0.7.0 introduces new features for better visualization of text.  Key features 
are Line Dance, a tool to jump between multiple lines in a given file; Group Tabs, 
for organizing large numbers of files; and Word Find, a quick-find tool built into 
the status bar.  Cataloged here are these and other features:

Text Organization:
-Line Dance (new): Bookmark positions so that you can jump between multiple 
places in the same file.
-File Tabs and Group Tabs (new): File tabs are a familiar way to open multiple 
files at once; group tabs are a new way to group these files by topic.  
Right-click to rename these groups.
-Word Find (new): A box for taking you directly to the typed word.
-Line Find (updated): A box that takes you directly to the given line number.  
Right-click on the line number in the status bar to record it in Line Find.
-Tab Navigation (updated): Back/Forward browser-style navigation between 
file tabs.  Many bug fixes.
-Wrap Indent: A tool to graphically indent wrapped lines, without modifying the 
underlying text.
-Emacs/Pico/Standard Shortcuts: A variety of commonly used shortcuts styles 
are offered in the Preferences.
-Reopen Tabs: Remembers the file tabs opened during the previous session, 
similar to Session History in Firefox.
-Auto-Save: Keeps your files up-to-date, all the time.

Text Manipulation:
-Plugin model for specially designed textual manipulation tasks.
-PlugInWindowTemplate (new): A template for creating plug-ins with option 
windows.
-Song Sheet (newly updated): A plugin for transposing chords in guitar music 
or removing those chords entirely for song sheets.  Updated for better 
identification of chords and easier chord transposition.
-Search and Stats (newly updated): A plugin for finding/replacing text and 
keeping track of text stats.  Updates include fixes in the replace all function.
-Extra Returns Remover: A plugin for removing email reply markers (">>") and 
unnecessary line breaks, while preserving line breaks in lists.
-HTML Stripper: A plugin that wades through HTML code to give just the text.
-HTML View: Does just the opposite, converting plain text into HTML code.

Other Features and Fixes in v.0.7.0:
-Duplicate File Detection: Prevents opening the same file twice or saving over a 
currently opened file.
-Import/export/reset preferences buttons for backing up preferred settings.
-During a search, found text is automatically scrolled to the top.
-Easier to read Shortcuts tips.
-ALT-TAB workaround for Java bug in v.1.4 and now again in Java 6.
-Compiled and tested on Windows, Fedora Core Linux 6, and MacOS X 10.4 
systems with Java 5 and 6.

----Family of Really Innovative ENDS (FRIENDS) Series----
---------------------------------------------------------------------

----v.0.5.1 (3/30/06)----

Our v.0.5.1 release of Text Trix is the first bug-cruncher in our new FRIENDS 
(Family of Really Innovative ENDS) series.  Our goal in this series is to get 
serious about making friends of Text Trix.  We're seeking to create a family of 
plugins that will be a one-stop resource, and "end" to your search for text 
tools that make your typing easier.  Or an "end*s*," cuz with Text Trix, the 
family keeps growing, and the trix never end!

Of course, to build a family, we need a solid home to house it.  This release 
focuses on crunching a few bugs in Text Trix itself as well as a couple of its 
plugins.  Notable behind-the-scenes fixes include removal of a couple 
start-up errors you reported on some platforms.  The new Song Sheet plugin 
also has a few tweaks to work with a wider variety of text formatting.

Every house needs an exterminator...but soon we'll need a decorator!  We've 
blasted a few bugs here, and now we're looking for new decor.  If you have 
ideas for a plugin or would like to write your own, please don't hesitate to 
post one.  We look forward to your joining the family!

----v.0.5.0 (5/8/05)----

Text Trix v.0.5.0 represents the culmination of our Feature Series, where 
Text Trix evolved from a simple editor with a few specialized tool add-ons to 
a one-stop chest of text tools.  Text Trix acts as a text manager by 
helping people organize and navigate through their text files.  Tabbed 
browsing, including forward/back browser-style navigation; wrap-indent, 
which visually aligns word-wrapped text; multiple keyboard shortcut models; 
and Line Find, a find-as-you-type navigator for line numbers, are just some of 
the features that make managing text easier with Text Trix.  Plus, the 
specialized tools--the plugins--are more integrated than ever, most including 
customized option windows to make updating lots of text a little deal.

New features include:
-Wrap-Indent, renewed and reinvigorated: Total Line Align for uniform 
indentation within each paragraph; section indent by highlighting paragraphs 
and pressing TAB (Shift-TAB to unindent); and numerous bug fixes
-Line Find, featuring a permanent text box that navigates directly to the line 
as it is typed into the box
-File refresher in case a file is changed elsewhere
-Plug-ins can choose the region of text to work on
-Extra Returns Remover plug-in, for reformatting emailed text, has a new 
options window, including the choice to include reply-region boundary 
markers, threshold line lengths, and list markers
-Integrated Windowing Design is highly streamlined and simplified to keep all 
windows, including those from plug-ins, visible at once
-Build process includes a "configure" script for streamlined customizability, 
reduced rebuilding redundancy, and expanded build tasks, such as API 
documentation generation and program installation
-Several new icons (courtesy of Stephen Liu)

Fixes include:
-Search plug-in's Replace function follows more standard behavior and fixes 
a few critical errors, while the plug-in also includes a new "Results" field to 
summarize what it has done (#1007487)
-Print function restores the indentation, including wrap-indent, that it 
apparently had lost (#1067823)
-Auto-save no longer tries to save now-closed files (#1007497)
-Faulty plug-ins no longer tear down the entire menu bar creation (#1092036)

Fixes since v.0.5.0rc1:
-Reuse of empty, unchanged tabs during file openings now restored 
(#1184694)
-Line Find only goes to the line if a new number is input or Enter is pressed 
within the box (#1184698)
-Search plugin tips corrected for "^t" and "^n" to find tabs and newlines, 
respectively (#1184700)
-Text Trix and its plugins load remotely from My Network Places on Windows 
platforms (#1184701)
-Tab reopenings and auto-detection for wrap-indent files is now on by default 
(#1184705)
-Enlarged default Search plugin window so not a grain of it is missed! 
(#1184709)

----v.0.3 Series: FEATure Series (FEATS)----
-------------------------------------------------------

----v.0.3.5 (6/1/04)----

Text Trix, the text tinker, whips into gear with its new WYSIWYP printing 
system, auto-save function, and integrated windowing design.  "WYSIWYP" 
derives from the lofty standard for pure text processing, "What You See Is 
What You Get" (WYSIWYG).  In many cases "what you get" (WYG) is 
ultimately "what you print" (WYP), so that what you see on the page is 
exactly what you get in print.  With Text Trix's new print function, feel free to 
adjust the window width, squeezing text together or spreading it over few 
lines, and see a print preview of the same alignment.

The new auto-save and integrated windowing design ensure that you can 
focus on your text instead of managing its surroundings.  Auto-save 
preserves your file changes automatically, on your time scale.  The 
integrated windowing remembers plug-in windows' positions and focuses all 
windows simultaneously so that the entire Text Trix workspace remains 
visible.

Behind the scenes, Text Trix development remains at the forefront.  That 
includes developing Text Trix, complete with revised build and packaging 
scripts for one-step building in most cases, and using Text Trix to develop 
other programs through the new status bar with line tracking and updated 
word-wrap auto-indent compatible with the upcoming v.1.5 release of the 
Java Virtual Machine.  Text Trix continues to focus on text--its own, that of 
other programs, and of course yours.

New features include:
-What You See Is What You Print (WYSIWYP) printing system to print the 
same alignment you see on screen
-Auto-save, by your preference and according to your chosen time interval
-Integrated windowing design, which remembers your window positions and 
keeps windows together
-Status bar to track hard-returned lines
-Build scripts revised for one-step building in most cases by accepting an 
optional Java path argument and auto-detecting the Cygwin environment
-PlugInWindow class extends the PlugIn class to simplify graphical plug-in 
development
-Loop capability in the LetterPulse plug-in

Fixed bugs include:
-Auto-indent compatibility with JVM v.1.5.0-beta2
-Auto-indenting newly pasted text
-Shfit-backspace as normal backspace
-Button to close tabs
-Single-step undo for plug-in text manipulations

----v.0.3.4 (8/26/03)----

What's your preference?  The Text Trix writer will take your order.  The text 
tinkering tool sports a new Preferences panel to remember how you 
customize the writer.  If you would like, it can provide quick access to 
recently opened files or reopen them automatically at start-up.  You can also 
choose which set of shortcuts you want, including ones that shorten 
finger-reach and speed up typing.  It's your preference.

As the set of Text Trix plug-ins grows, people might not want to use every 
plug-in they have installed.  Now they can select which ones to ignore--or 
re-include them on the fly if desired.

The Text Trix writer continues to work to provide an on-the-go experience.  
With the new file history and preferences functions, users no longer have to 
manually reopen files or restore settings every time they start the program.  
Those settings include features unique to the writer, such as the 
auto-wrap-indent for particular types of files.  They also include Text Trix 
development, always on-the-go.

New features include:
-Preferences panel to save user settings
-Ability to remember files and reopen them automatically
-Three keybindings models: Standard, Emacs, and Hybrid
-Choice of which plug-ins to include or ignore
-Improved start-up performance by creating graphical components in 
separate threads

Bug fixes include:
-Plug-ins work again on selected text
-Tab history browsing follows new routes correctly for better quick-flipping 
among files
-When undo-ing, users no longer have to undo all the stylistic indents after 
turning on auto-indent

----v.0.3.3 (7/01/03)----

Ever tried to indent HTML and wished that all the lines would line up?  
Programs for text creation often wrap lines back to the left margin, not to the 
indentation.  Earlier Text Trix versions also did, but no longer.  The latest 
version sports a bolstered auto-indent function to automatically indent 
wrapped lines, without adding any extra tabs or returns.

The auto-indent feature works for any type of source code, not just HTML.  
Similarly, the Forward/Back function works whenever one edits multiple 
documents together, such as code spanning several files.  Rather than hunt 
for the correct tab, press Ctrl-Shift-[ to move Back to the most recently 
displayed text pad.  Continue to even earlier text pads, or press Ctrl-Shfit-] 
to move Forward to a later pad.

Plug-ins give options.  Install only the desired plug-ins.  Select preferences 
for each plug-in.  Previous versions of Text Trix began to fulfill the first goal.  
As for the second, now each plug-in can flash a window for users to choose 
their options.  The first "trix," or goofy, non-serious plug-in, provides a 
window for users to type in a message for a friend and select a time interval.  
The plug-in highlights the message letter-by-letter in the current text pad.

New features include:
-Indented wrapped lines when auto-indent is on (Alt-Shift-I)
-Forward/Back-style text pad navigation (Ctrl-Shift-]/[)
-Plug-ins with options windows
-More reasonable tab sizes
-Statistics feature counts the characters, words, and lines in the selected 
section
-Filenames display in the window's title bar
-The first "trix" from "Text Trix": the Letter Pulse goofy plug-in demonstrates 
the flexibility to update the text multiple times and incorporate options from 
a window

Bug fixes include:
-Plug-ins load correctly in JRE v.1.4.2
-Text pad tool tip updates to display the name of newly opened files
-Ctrl-Backspace deletes words consistently on all test platforms

----v.0.3.2 (3/18/03)----

Text Trix, the text tinkering tool, now has a plugin architecture to easily add 
new tools or trix.  Not everyone wants the same text manipulators; now each 
person can pick and choose.  What's left is to build a repertoire of plugins.

The main impediment to recent Text Trix development had been getting over 
the plugin hump.  The idea of adding tiny, self-sufficient packages for each 
new tinkerer proved attractive, but methods to load and use them proved 
quite the opposite.  Also, with the major football season rolling around, work 
on another text project (tXtFL, http://textflex.com/txtfl) became increasingly 
enticing.

But the football season is over for now; it's time for school and work again, 
where text tools have more practical use than text football has.  Extra 
motivation to write the plugin platform came from an unexpected source: bugs 
that stopped the tinkerers from working on one popular operating system.  
This release addresses these bugs and provides the new architecture, which 
now awaits contributions for new tools and trix!

New features include:
-Plugin architecture allows users to selet the particular tools and trix they 
want
-Multiple files can open at once
-Files can open from the command-line at startup; try using Text Trix as the 
default program to open files
-Carets now return approximately to their original location after each text 
tinkerer runs
-Dialog windows provide alternative options when opening or saving to 
non-permitted locations

Bug fixes include:
-Text tools now work consistently and in all tested platforms (691520)
-The function to find whole words now finds them (699860)
-Popup menus also work consistently across tested platforms (696328)
-Tabbed pane tool tips update to show the new file name after saving a file 
for the first time (699865)

----v.0.3.1 (8/26/02)----

One might miss out on many trix if Text Trix lacked support for 
colored text, different fonts, and images.  Let the situation remain 
hypothetical, for Text Trix now offers HTML and RTF formatted 
text viewing.  Now the editor just needs some trix.  As for tools, 
Text Trix can tinker with the whole text or only selected text now, 
and the auto-indent feature makes coding in Text Trix--such as 
programming trix, for example?--more feasible.

-HTML and RTF viewing, including conversion of plain text to 
HTML-tagged text
-Auto-indent, selectable for each text pad
-Open/save as dialogs return to the current tab's working directory 
or the last opened/saved as directory
-Tab-cycling shortcut keys that work within text pads
-HTML replacer additions: removes extraneous spaces and 
replaces some common character entities, such as "&nbsp;"
-Text pad popup menu, including copy/paste menu items
-Various bug fixes

----v.0.3.0 (7/23/02)----

The feature craze has begun!  With the beginnings of an HTML tag 
replacer, a non-printing-character display, and a fully featured 
find/replace tool, the "Trix" in Text Trix is bearing fruit.  A few 
interface improvements round out the Basic User Graphics Series 
(BUGS) and make way for the Feature Future of futuristic features.

-rudimentary HTML tag replacer, removing all HTML-style tags 
and replacing them with text representations where appropriate
-find/replace function, including options to search for expressions 
as separate words, ignore case, replace first/all, selection search, 
and wrapped search
-non-printing-character display, adding the displays into the text 
explicitly
-focuses on Text Pad immediately after start-up
-cancelled save during window frame closure and in exiting save 
dialogs prevent the exit
-open/save boxes now attached to main Text Trix window
-equivalency string tables in preparation for preferences feature

----------------------------------------------
----v.0.1 Series: Basic User Graphics Series (BUGS)----
----------------------------------------------

----v.0.1.5 (6/26/02)----

The basic user interface portion of Text Trix is nearing completion.
This release focuses on large structural changes and text 
tools.  Structural work prepares for the Txtrx command-
line version of Text Trix and makes the code more extensible.  
Features work centers on making the Extra Hard Return 
Remover more efficient and less buggy while conferring the
ability to remove " > "'s common in email replies.  Additionally,
