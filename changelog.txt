----v.0.3 Series: FEATure Series (FEATS)----
--------------------------------------

----v.0.3.3 (6/30/03)----

Ever tried to indent HTML and wished that all the lines would line up?  Programs for writing text often wrap lines back to the left margin, not to the orignal indentation.  Even earlier Text Trix versions did that, but no longer.  The latest version sports a bolstered auto-indent function to automatically line up all the text, without adding any extra tabs or returns.

The auto-indent feature works for any type of source code, not just HTML.  Similarly, the Forward/Back function works any time one edits multiple documents at once, such as code spanning several files.  Press Ctrl-Shift-[, and the Text Trix editor shifts to the most recently displayed tab, regardless of its distance from the current one.  Continue to previous tabs, or press Ctrl-Shfit-] to go to the original tab.

The idea behind plug-ins is to allow people to use them however the people would like.  Install the plug-ins one wants.  Choose the plug-in options to suit one's preference.  Previous versions of Text Trix began to fulfill the first goal, and now plug-ins can flash windows for users to enter their options.  The first "trix," or goofy plug-in, provides a window for users to type in the message and time interval they want to highlight letter-by-letter in the current text.

New features include:
-Tab sizes are more reasonable and can indent even non-wrapped lines when auto-indent is on
-Forward/Back-style tab navigation
-Plug-ins with options windows
-Statistics feature counts the characters, words, and lines in a chosen section
-Filenames display in the window's title bar
-Letter Pulse plug-in demonstrates the flexibility to update the text multiple times and incorporate options from a window

Bug fixes include:
-Plug-ins load in JRE v.1.4.2-beta
-Tab tool tip updates when opening new file
-Ctrl-Backspace deletes words consistently on all test platforms

----v.0.3.2 (3/18/03)----

Text Trix, the text tinkering tool, now has a plugin architecture to easily add 
new tools or trix.  Not everyone wants the same text manipulators; now each 
person can pick and choose.  What's left is to build a repertoire of plugins.

The main impediment to recent Text Trix development had been getting over 
the plugin hump.  The idea of adding tiny, self-sufficient packages for each 
new tinkerer proved attractive, but methods to load and use them proved 
quite the opposite.  Also, with the major football season rolling around, work 
on another text project (tXtFL, http://textflex.com/txtfl) became increasingly 
enticing.

But the football season is over for now; it's time for school and work again, 
where text tools have more practical use than text football has.  Extra 
motivation to write the plugin platform came from an unexpected source: bugs 
that stopped the tinkerers from working on one popular operating system.  
This release addresses these bugs and provides the new architecture, which 
now awaits contributions for new tools and trix!

New features include:
-Plugin architecture allows users to selet the particular tools and trix they 
want
-Multiple files can open at once
-Files can open from the command-line at startup; try using Text Trix as the 
default program to open files
-Carets now return approximately to their original location after each text 
tinkerer runs
-Dialog windows provide alternative options when opening or saving to 
non-permitted locations

Bug fixes include:
-Text tools now work consistently and in all tested platforms (691520)
-The function to find whole words now finds them (699860)
-Popup menus also work consistently across tested platforms (696328)
-Tabbed pane tool tips update to show the new file name after saving a file 
for the first time (699865)

----v.0.3.1 (8/26/02)----

One might miss out on many trix if Text Trix lacked support for 
colored text, different fonts, and images.  Let the situation remain 
hypothetical, for Text Trix now offers HTML and RTF formatted 
text viewing.  Now the editor just needs some trix.  As for tools, 
Text Trix can tinker with the whole text or only selected text now, 
and the auto-indent feature makes coding in Text Trix--such as 
programming trix, for example?--more feasible.

-HTML and RTF viewing, including conversion of plain text to 
HTML-tagged text
-Auto-indent, selectable for each text pad
-Open/save as dialogs return to the current tab's working directory 
or the last opened/saved as directory
-Tab-cycling shortcut keys that work within text pads
-HTML replacer additions: removes extraneous spaces and 
replaces some common character entities, such as "&nbsp;"
-Text pad popup menu, including copy/paste menu items
-Various bug fixes

----v.0.3.0 (7/23/02)----

The feature craze has begun!  With the beginnings of an HTML tag 
replacer, a non-printing-character display, and a fully featured 
find/replace tool, the "Trix" in Text Trix is bearing fruit.  A few 
interface improvements round out the Basic User Graphics Series 
(BUGS) and make way for the Feature Future of futuristic features.

-rudimentary HTML tag replacer, removing all HTML-style tags 
and replacing them with text representations where appropriate
-find/replace function, including options to search for expressions 
as separate words, ignore case, replace first/all, selection search, 
and wrapped search
-non-printing-character display, adding the displays into the text 
explicitly
-focuses on Text Pad immediately after start-up
-cancelled save during window frame closure and in exiting save 
dialogs prevent the exit
-open/save boxes now attached to main Text Trix window
-equivalency string tables in preparation for preferences feature

----v.0.1 Series: Basic User Graphics Series (BUGS)----
----------------------------------------------

----v.0.1.5 (6/26/02)----

The basic user interface portion of Text Trix is nearing completion.
This release focuses on large structural changes and text 
tools.  Structural work prepares for the Txtrx command-
line version of Text Trix and makes the code more extensible.  
Features work centers on making the Extra Hard Return 
Remover more efficient and less buggy while conferring the
ability to remove " > "'s common in email replies.  Additionally, 
word deletion is in place.

-Extra Hard Return Remover additions and updates, including 
inline message reply sign (eg " > ") and "<pre>" tag removal, 
as well as more efficient processing
-tool bar, icons, and extra menus, including their shortcuts
-word delete, including Emacs keybindings for it and word
movement
-file-changed indicator update: no delay

----v.0.1.4 (4/27/01)----

-modified-yet-unsaved files show a " *"
-basic Emacs shortcut keys
-can use tabs in hard return list
-more reasonable tab size
-checks whether all files are saved before exiting
-Undo/Redo, including multiple ones
-remembers last "Save" and "Open" paths
-"Save" function in addition to "Save as..."
-caret moves to beginning of document after opening it
-bug fix: syncs tab index with arraylist index
-added About and License menu items
-switched file input to getResourceAsStream for possible
applet use in future

----v.0.1.3 (3/24/02)----

-file open and save as options
-check for file modification when closing
-enhanced superfluous hard return checK: now ignores spaces
before dashes or asterisks when checking to allow listed
items to have their own line

-switched open source license from GPL to BSD
-multiple text areas
-tabbed pane for each new text area
-menu bar, including accelerators
