----v.0.3 Series: FEATure Series (FEATS)----
-------------------------------------------------------

----v.0.3.5 (6/1/04)----

Text Trix, the text tinker, whips into gear with its new WYSIWYP printing system, auto-save function, and integrated windowing design.  "WYSIWYP" derives from the lofty standard for pure text processing, "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG).  In many cases "what you get" (WYG) is ultimately "what you print" (WYP), so that what you see on the page is exactly what you get in print.  Feel free to adjust the window width, squeezing the text together or spreading it over few lines, and see a print preview of the same alignment.

The new auto-save and integrated windowing design ensure that you can focus on your text instead of managing its surroundings.  Auto-save preserves your file changes automatically, on your time scale.  The integrated windowing remembers plug-in windows' positions and focuses all windows simultaneously so that the entire Text Trix workspace remains visible.

Behind the scenes, Text Trix development remains at the forefront.  That includes developing Text Trix, complete with revised build and packaging scripts for one-step building in most cases, and using Text Trix to develop other programs through the new status bar with line tracking and updated word-wrap auto-indent compatible with the upcoming v.1.5 of the Java Virtual Machine.  Text Trix continues to focus on text--its own, that of other programs, and of course yours.

New features include:
-What You See Is What You Print (WYSIWYP) printing system to print the same alignment you see on screen
-Auto-save, by your preference and according to your chosen time interval
-Integrated windowing design, which remembers your window positions and keeps them together
-Status bar to track hard-return lines
-Build scripts revised for one-step building in most cases by accepting an optional Java path argument and auto-detecting the Cygwin environment
-PlugIn classes split into parent PlugIn and child PlugInWindow classes to simplify graphical plug-in development
-Loop capability in the LetterPulse plug-in

Fixed bugs include:
-Auto-indent compatibility with JVM v.1.5.0-beta2
-Auto-indenting newly pasted text
-Shfit-backspace as normal backspace
-Button to close tabs

----v.0.3.4 (8/26/03)----

What's your preference?  The Text Trix writer will take your order.  The text 
tinkering tool sports a new Preferences panel to remember how you 
customize the writer.  If you would like, it can provide quick access to 
recently opened files or reopen them automatically at start-up.  You can also 
choose which set of shortcuts you want, including ones that shorten 
finger-reach and speed up typing.  It's your preference.

As the set of Text Trix plug-ins grows, people might not want to use every 
plug-in they have installed.  Now they can select which ones to ignore--or 
re-include them on the fly if desired.

The Text Trix writer continues to work to provide an on-the-go experience.  
With the new file history and preferences functions, users no longer have to 
manually reopen files or restore settings every time they start the program.  
Those settings include features unique to the writer, such as the 
auto-wrap-indent for particular types of files.  They also include Text Trix 
development, always on-the-go.

New features include:
-Preferences panel to save user settings
-Ability to remember files and reopen them automatically
-Three keybindings models: Standard, Emacs, and Hybrid
-Choice of which plug-ins to include or ignore
-Improved start-up performance by creating graphical components in 
separate threads

Bug fixes include:
-Plug-ins work again on selected text
-Tab history browsing follows new routes correctly for better quick-flipping 
among files
-When undo-ing, users no longer have to undo all the stylistic indents after 
turning on auto-indent

----v.0.3.3 (7/01/03)----

Ever tried to indent HTML and wished that all the lines would line up?  
Programs for text creation often wrap lines back to the left margin, not to the 
indentation.  Earlier Text Trix versions also did, but no longer.  The latest 
version sports a bolstered auto-indent function to automatically indent 
wrapped lines, without adding any extra tabs or returns.

The auto-indent feature works for any type of source code, not just HTML.  
Similarly, the Forward/Back function works whenever one edits multiple 
documents together, such as code spanning several files.  Rather than hunt 
for the correct tab, press Ctrl-Shift-[ to move Back to the most recently 
displayed text pad.  Continue to even earlier text pads, or press Ctrl-Shfit-] 
to move Forward to a later pad.

Plug-ins give options.  Install only the desired plug-ins.  Select preferences 
for each plug-in.  Previous versions of Text Trix began to fulfill the first goal.  
As for the second, now each plug-in can flash a window for users to choose 
their options.  The first "trix," or goofy, non-serious plug-in, provides a 
window for users to type in a message for a friend and select a time interval.  
The plug-in highlights the message letter-by-letter in the current text pad.

New features include:
-Indented wrapped lines when auto-indent is on (Alt-Shift-I)
-Forward/Back-style text pad navigation (Ctrl-Shift-]/[)
-Plug-ins with options windows
-More reasonable tab sizes
-Statistics feature counts the characters, words, and lines in the selected 
section
-Filenames display in the window's title bar
-The first "trix" from "Text Trix": the Letter Pulse goofy plug-in demonstrates 
the flexibility to update the text multiple times and incorporate options from 
a window

Bug fixes include:
-Plug-ins load correctly in JRE v.1.4.2
-Text pad tool tip updates to display the name of newly opened files
-Ctrl-Backspace deletes words consistently on all test platforms

----v.0.3.2 (3/18/03)----

Text Trix, the text tinkering tool, now has a plugin architecture to easily add 
new tools or trix.  Not everyone wants the same text manipulators; now each 
person can pick and choose.  What's left is to build a repertoire of plugins.

The main impediment to recent Text Trix development had been getting over 
the plugin hump.  The idea of adding tiny, self-sufficient packages for each 
new tinkerer proved attractive, but methods to load and use them proved 
quite the opposite.  Also, with the major football season rolling around, work 
on another text project (tXtFL, http://textflex.com/txtfl) became increasingly 
enticing.

But the football season is over for now; it's time for school and work again, 
where text tools have more practical use than text football has.  Extra 
motivation to write the plugin platform came from an unexpected source: bugs 
that stopped the tinkerers from working on one popular operating system.  
This release addresses these bugs and provides the new architecture, which 
now awaits contributions for new tools and trix!

New features include:
-Plugin architecture allows users to selet the particular tools and trix they 
want
-Multiple files can open at once
-Files can open from the command-line at startup; try using Text Trix as the 
default program to open files
-Carets now return approximately to their original location after each text 
tinkerer runs
-Dialog windows provide alternative options when opening or saving to 
non-permitted locations

Bug fixes include:
-Text tools now work consistently and in all tested platforms (691520)
-The function to find whole words now finds them (699860)
-Popup menus also work consistently across tested platforms (696328)
-Tabbed pane tool tips update to show the new file name after saving a file 
for the first time (699865)

----v.0.3.1 (8/26/02)----

One might miss out on many trix if Text Trix lacked support for 
colored text, different fonts, and images.  Let the situation remain 
hypothetical, for Text Trix now offers HTML and RTF formatted 
text viewing.  Now the editor just needs some trix.  As for tools, 
Text Trix can tinker with the whole text or only selected text now, 
and the auto-indent feature makes coding in Text Trix--such as 
programming trix, for example?--more feasible.

-HTML and RTF viewing, including conversion of plain text to 
HTML-tagged text
-Auto-indent, selectable for each text pad
-Open/save as dialogs return to the current tab's working directory 
or the last opened/saved as directory
-Tab-cycling shortcut keys that work within text pads
-HTML replacer additions: removes extraneous spaces and 
replaces some common character entities, such as "&nbsp;"
-Text pad popup menu, including copy/paste menu items
-Various bug fixes

----v.0.3.0 (7/23/02)----

The feature craze has begun!  With the beginnings of an HTML tag 
replacer, a non-printing-character display, and a fully featured 
find/replace tool, the "Trix" in Text Trix is bearing fruit.  A few 
interface improvements round out the Basic User Graphics Series 
(BUGS) and make way for the Feature Future of futuristic features.

-rudimentary HTML tag replacer, removing all HTML-style tags 
and replacing them with text representations where appropriate
-find/replace function, including options to search for expressions 
as separate words, ignore case, replace first/all, selection search, 
and wrapped search
-non-printing-character display, adding the displays into the text 
explicitly
-focuses on Text Pad immediately after start-up
-cancelled save during window frame closure and in exiting save 
dialogs prevent the exit
-open/save boxes now attached to main Text Trix window
-equivalency string tables in preparation for preferences feature
