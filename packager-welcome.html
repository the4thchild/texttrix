		<h1>Welcome to Text Trix&#153;!</h1>
		
		<p>Text Trix is general purpose editor that makes coding easier and more precise.  Navigational tools help make large files easier to read and organize.  Special plugins manipulate text according to user-defined settings.</p>
		
		<p>v.0.7.0 introduces new features for better visualization of text.  Key features are Line Dance, a tool to jump between multiple lines in a given file; Group Tabs, for organizing large numbers of files; and Word Find, a quick-find tool built into the status bar.
		
		<h2>New features in v.0.7.0:</h2>
		<p>
			-<b>Line Dance:</b> Make bookmarks so that you can work in multiple places in the same file with the press of a button.<br>
			-<b>Group Tabs:</b> File tabs are a familiar way to open multiple files at once; group tabs are a new way to group these files by topic. Right-click to rename these groups.<br>
			-<b>Word Find:</b> A box for taking you directly to the typed word; use F3 to navigate.<br>
			-<b>Line Find (newly updated):</b> A box that takes you directly to the given line number. Right-click on the line number in the status bar to record that number in Line Find.<br>
			-<b>Song Sheet (newly updated):</b> A plugin for transposing chords in guitar music or removing those chords entirely for song sheets; updated to include flats ("b") and make half-stepping more user friendly.<br>
			-<b>Import/Export/Reset</b> preferences buttons for backing up preferred settings.<br>
