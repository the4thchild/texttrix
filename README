RELEASE NOTES

Another bug fix release with a few small features including basic support 
for auto-indent with spaces. Also saves the tab list with each newly 
opened file.

-Saves tab list on-the-fly for restoring during next session
-Fixed additional empty window from occasionally opening at startup
-Fixed inappropriate font size reduction in some cases

Known issues/requirements:

you can use a previous version of Text Trix (through v.0.9.4).
