Some shortcuts only work when the text pane is focused.

----What's the difference among the keybindings?----

-Standard Keybindings: What you're used to.
-Hybrid Keybindings: A fresh blend of Emacs single character and line navigation shortcuts plus the standard ones.
-Emacs Keybindings: Emacs shortcuts all the way--well, at least for single-charcter combos--well, at least for some of them.
