Mistakers and Tools Notes
------------------
Extra Hard Return Remover:
-this is our first feature! (a practical one)
-removes all hard returns, except between multiply-spaced lines or in lists
-to write a list without losing its hard returns, keep all the
elements in a given block single-spaced, and use dashes or asterisks
at the start of each line after the first; note that indents with tabs are a-ok
-text enclosed in <pre></pre> tags will not have hard
returns removed; only the tags will be removed
-lines beginning with ">" or "<", such as those in email replies, will be 
removed along with any spaces surrounding them; "---Original Message----"
will be added before the region, and "-------------" will come afterward
