<html><b>Extra Hard Returns Remover</b>

<p><i>Removes all hard returns, except between 
<br>multiply-spaced lines or in lists</i></p>

<p>-To write a <font color=red>list</font> without losing its hard returns, 
<br>keep all the elements in a given block single-spaced 
<br>and use dashes, asterisks, numbers, or tabs at the 
<br>start of each line after the first</p>

<p>-Text enclosed in <font color=red>&#060;pre&#062;&#060;/pre&#062;</font> tags will be preserved; 
<br>each tag should be placed on its own line and will be removed</p>

<p>-Lines beginning with <font color=red>"&#062;"</font>, such as " &#062; &#062; "
<br>in email replies, will be removed along with 
<br>any spaces surrounding them; "---Original Message----" 
<br>will be added before the region, and "-------------" will 
<br>come afterward</p>

<p>-If necessary, undo changes by selecting Undo (Edit > Undo) twice</p>
