<html><b>Extra Hard Returns Remover</b>

<p><i>Removes all hard returns, except between 
<br>multiply-spaced lines or in lists</i></p>

<p>-to write a <font color=red>list</font> without 
<br>losing its hard returns, keep all the elements 
<br>in a given block single-spaced, and use dashes or 
<br>asterisks at the start of each line after the first; 
<br>note that indents with tabs are a-ok</p>

<p>-text enclosed in <font color=red>&#060;pre&#062;&#060;/pre&#062;</font> tags will be preserved; 
<br>the tags should each be placed on its own line and 
<br>will be removed</p>

<p>-lines beginning with <font color=red>"&#062;" or "&#060;"</font>, such 
<br>as those in email replies, will be removed along with 
<br>any spaces surrounding them; "---Original Message----" 
<br>will be added before the region, and "-------------" will 
<br>come afterward
