----Extra Returns Remover: removes all hard returns, except between multi-spaced lines or in lists (this was our first feature!)----

-To write a list without losing its hard returns, leave the first line of a block unmarked and use dashes, asterisks, numbers, or tabs at the start of each line after the first. Add an empty line between blocks.
-Text enclosed in <pre></pre> tags will be preserved. Each tag should be placed on its own line to ensure the tags' removal.
-Lines beginning with ">", such as " > > " in email replies, will be removed along with any spaces surrounding them; "---Original Message----" will be added before the region, and "-------------" will come afterward
-Select the text to modify, or leave it unhighlighted to work on the whole text
-If necessary, undo changes by selecting Undo [Edit > Undo (2x), or Ctrl-z (2x)]

-All HTML tags get removed. Where appropriate, their plain-text equivalents are substituted

----Non-Printing-Character Viewer: make visible characters for non-printing ones----
