--------------
Find and Replace: Find a given text and replace it with another text

-Search for a sequence of characters a specific word
-Replace with another sequence if desired
-Optionally replace all or just the first instance of the given text
-Can choose to search within highlighted text only

-----------------------
Extra Hard Return Remover: removes all hard returns, except between multiply-spaced lines or in lists (this was our first feature!)

-To write a list without losing its hard returns, keep all the elements in a given block single-spaced, and use dashes or asterisks at the start of each line after the first; note that indents with tabs are a-ok
-Text enclosed in <pre></pre> tags will be preserved; each tag should be placed on its own line and will be removed
-Lines beginning with ">", such as those in email replies, will be removed along with any spaces surrounding them; "---Original Message----" will be added before the region, and "-------------" will come afterward
-Select the text to modify, or leave completely unhighlighted to work on the whole text
-If necessary, undo the change through as many Undo commands as necessary (Edit > Undo, or Ctrl-z)

------------
HTML Replacer: Replace HTML tags with their plain-text equivalent

-All HTML tags get removed.  Where appropriate, their plain-text equivalents are substituted
-E.g., "&#060;b&#062;" becomes "*"
-Select the text to modify, or leave completely unhighlighted to work on the whole text

--------------------------
Non-Printing-Character Viewer: Add visual identification of non-printing characters

-In the current text, the viewer writes "\n" before every hard return, and "\t" before every tab
-Select the text to modify, or leave completely unhighlighted to work on the whole text
-To remove the characters, Undo (ctrl-z) at least twice

----------
Auto-Indent: Automatically indent as far as the previous line's indentation

-For any tab that could use auto-indentation, select the option in the Edit menu (Edit > Options > Auto-indent)
-Text Trix will add as many tabs to a given line as that on the previous line; note that spaces are not counted as indents
-Unselect the option at any time, for as many tabs as desired

---------
View HTML: Converts the current text into HTML format and displays it as a web browser would

-Choose the option from the View menu (View > Toggle HTML view)
-Note that the viewing alters the underlying plain text.  View the alteration by choosing the plain text view (View > Toggle plain text view).  Changes can be undone as usual (Edit > Undo, or Ctrl-z, as many times as necessary)
-Text can be edited directly in the HTML view, but styles can only be changed by first switching to the plain text view and applying HTML tags by hand
-Note that the HTML viewer has some limitations, such as only HTML v.3.2 support and the requirement of a basename tag for images

---------
View RTF: View RTF-formatted text as formatted text

-Choose the option from the View manu (View > Toggle RTF view)
-The text must already be in RTF format; the viewing does not alter the underlying plain text
-Text can be edited directly in the RTF view, but styles can only be changed by first switching to the plain text view and applying RTF formats by hand
