----Search and Stats: Count on finding text and counting it----

-Search for a sequence of characters or a specific word
-Replace with another sequence if desired
-Optionally replace all occurrences or just the first
-Choose to search within highlighted text only
-Get word, character, and line counts on all or only selected text

----Extra Returns Remover: Remove hard returns to re-wrap lines, as in emails (this was our first feature!)----

-To write a list without losing its hard returns, leave the first line of a block unmarked and use dashes, asterisks, numbers, or tabs at the start of each subsequent line.  Add an empty line between blocks.
-Text enclosed in <pre></pre> tags will be preserved. Each tag should be placed on its own line to ensure the tags' removal.
-Lines beginning with ">", such as " > > " in email replies, will be removed along with any spaces surrounding them; "---Original Message----" will be added before the region, and "-------------" will come afterward
-Select the text to modify, or leave it unhighlighted to tinker with all the text
-If necessary, undo changes by selecting Undo [Edit > Undo (2x), or Ctrl-z (2x)]

----HTML Replacer: Replace HTML tags with plain-text equivalents----

-All HTML tags get removed. Where appropriate, their plain-text equivalents are substituted
-E.g., "<b>" becomes "*"
-Select the text to modify, or leave it unhighlighted to tinker with all the text
-If necessary, undo changes by selecting Undo [Edit > Undo (2x), or Ctrl-z (2x)]

----Non-Printing-Character Viewer: make visible characters for non-printing ones----

-Writes "\n" before every hard return, and "\t" before every tab
-Select the text to modify, or leave it unhighlighted to tinker with all the text
-If necessary, undo changes by selecting Undo [Edit > Undo (2x), or Ctrl-z (2x)]

----Letter Pulse: Highlight hidden messages by letter pulsing----

-Open or type text with a goodly amount of letters
-Choose the message to highlight within the Letter Pulse options window
-Set the time interval between pulses
-Start pulsing, and watch the message reveal itself sequentially within your message
-If the pulsing stops before its time, try writing more text and restarting the pulse
