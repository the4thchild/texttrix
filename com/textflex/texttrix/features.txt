--------------
Find and Replace: Find a given text and replace it with another text

-Search for a sequence of characters a specific word
-Replace with another sequence if desired
-Optionally replace all or just the first instance of the given text
-Can choose to search within highlighted text only

-----------------------
Extra Hard Return Remover: removes all hard returns, except between multiply-spaced lines or in lists (this was our first feature!)

-To write a list without losing its hard returns, keep all the
elements in a given block single-spaced, and use dashes or asterisks
at the start of each line after the first; note that indents with tabs are a-ok
-Text enclosed in <pre></pre> tags will be preserved; each tag should 
be placed on its own line and will be removed
-Lines beginning with ">", such as those in email replies, will be 
removed along with any spaces surrounding them; "---Original Message----"
will be added before the region, and "-------------" will come afterward
-If necessary, undo the change through two Undo commands (Edit > Undo)

------------
HTML Replacer: Replace HTML tags with their plain-text equivalent

-All HTML tags get removed.  Where appropriate, their plain-text equivalents 
are substituted
-E.g., "&#060;b&#062;" becomes "*"

--------------------------
Non-Printing-Character Viewer: Add visual identification of non-printing 
characters

-In the current text, the viewer writes "\n" before every hard return, and "\t" 
before every tab
-To remove the characters, Undo (ctrl-z) at least twice
