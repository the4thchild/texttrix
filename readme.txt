-----------------
Welcome to Text Trix!  We're just getting underway here.  Please try us out!

System Reqs:
-Java[tm] 2 Runtime Environment (http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp) or Software Development Kit 1.4+ (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html), 
freely available from Sun Microsystems(TM)

Instructions for use:
-Unzip the Text Trix[tm] package by double-clicking on the Jar Ajar[tm] self-extracting file, 
"texttrix-x.y.z-jarajar-extractor.jar".  Follow the instructions to unpack the 
file.
-Double-click on "TextTrix.jar" in the directory that you unpacked

Troubleshooting:
-Ensure that the Java 2 Runtime Environment, v.1.4+, is installed.  Point your 
browser to http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html and click on the Download 
banner to check.  Even if the browser does not indicate that the Environment is 
installed, however, it may be.  To check, try opening a command prompt, 
typing "java -version", and looking for output displaying version 1.4 or higher.  
See http://textflex.com/texttrix/faq.html#jre for more details.
-For use on Windows(R) systems: check that the desktop is set to use "javaw" 
for ".jar" programs
-For use on Linux(R) or MacOS(R) X system: check that the application/x-jar 
MIME type is both supported and executes the command, "java -jar" on the file
-If necessary, try unzipping and running Text Trix via the command line:
	-Move into the folder holding "texttrix-x.y.z-jarajar-extractor.jar" 
	by typing: "cd [folder holding the jarajar package]"
	-Run the package and follow its instructions: 
	"java -jar texttrix-x.y.z-jarajar-extractor.jar"
	-After file extraction, move into the TextTrix folder: 
	"cd texttrix-x.y.z"
	-Start Text Trix: "java -jar TextTrix.jar"
-See http://textflex.com/texttrix/faq.html for more details
