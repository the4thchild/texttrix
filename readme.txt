-----------------
Welcome to the Text Trix[tm] writer!  Text Trix tinkers with text. The text 
processor houses bunches of practical and goofy tools to mess with text. 
Make it really right, or wonderfully wrong.

System Reqs:
-Java[tm] Virtual Machine, v.1.4+ (http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html), 
freely available from Sun Microsystems[tm]; also available from IBM[tm] 
(https://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/lxdk/lxdk-p), offering the only major kit 
for Linux PPC systems (IBM SDK for 32-bit iSeries/pSeries)

Instructions for use:
-Install the Text Trix package by double-clicking on the Jar Ajar[tm] 
self-extracting file, "TextTrix-x.y.z-jarajar-selfextractor.jar".  Follow the 
instructions to unpack the file.
-Double-click on "TextTrix.jar" in the directory that you unpacked

Troubleshooting:
-Ensure that the Java Virtual Machine, v.1.4+, is installed.  To check, point 
your browser to http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html and click on the 
Download banner.  Even if the browser does not indicate that the virtual 
machine is installed, it may be.  If necessary, check by opening a command 
prompt, typing "java -version", and looking for output displaying version 1.4 or 
higher.  See http://textflex.com/texttrix/faq.html#jvm for more details, 
including how to set the PATH environment variable that looks for the "java" 
command automatically.
-For use on Windows(R) systems: check that the desktop is set to use 
"javaw" for ".jar" programs
-For use on Linux(R) or MacOS(R) X system: check that the 
application/x-jar MIME type is both supported and executes the command, 
"java -jar" on the file
-If necessary, try installing and running Text Trix via the command line:
	-Move into the folder holding "TextTrix-x.y.z-jarajar-extractor.jar" 
	by typing: "cd [folder holding the jarajar package]"
	-Run the package and follow its instructions: 
	"java -jar texttrix-x.y.z-jarajar-extractor.jar"
	-After file extraction, move into the TextTrix folder: 
	"cd texttrix-x.y.z"
	-Start Text Trix: "java -jar TextTrix.jar"
-See http://textflex.com/texttrix/faq.html for more details
