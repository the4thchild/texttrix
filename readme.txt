-----------------
Welcome to Text Trix[tm], the text tinker from Text Flex[tm]! Text Trix is a 
one-stop tool chest of text tools. Pick from an array of Text Trix "plug-ins," 
specialized tools that allow you to modify large amounts of text quickly and 
specifically. The tool chest has its own built-in features to help you organize 
and navigate through your code or text documents.

System Reqs:
-Java[tm] Virtual Machine, v.1.4+ (http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html), 
freely available from Sun Microsystems[tm]; also available from IBM[tm] 
(https://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/lxdk/lxdk-p), offering the only major kit 
for Linux PPC systems (IBM SDK for 32-bit iSeries/pSeries)

Instructions for use:
-Double-click on the Jar Ajar[tm] self-extracting file, 
"TextTrix-x.y.z-jarajar-selfextractor.jar".  Follow the 
instructions to unpack the file.
-Double-click on "TextTrix.jar" in the directory that you unpacked

Troubleshooting:
-Ensure that the Java Virtual Machine, v.1.4+, is installed.  See 
http://textflex.com/texttrix/faq.html#jvm for details, including how to set the 
PATH environment variable that looks for the "java" command 
automatically.
-On Windows(R) systems, check that the desktop is set to use "javaw" for 
".jar" programs
-On Linux(R) or MacOS(R) X system, check that the application/x-jar MIME 
type is both supported and executes the command, "java -jar" on the file
-If double-clicking doesn't work, try unpacking and running Text Trix via the 
command line: In the directory with the .jar file, type, "java -jar [JarFile].jar", 
where [JarFile] is the name of the package.
-See http://textflex.com/texttrix/faq.html for more details
